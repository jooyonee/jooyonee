ü™ÑI'M JOOYEON 

I'm the person really interested in programming and UI/UX design.

I studied python by myself on a coding website.
And currently I'm learning JavaScript, Photoshop and Figma etc.

Before that I had joined in a project with my friend for building a website for my creative character.üê∂

After that, I really became interested in web programming, especially #FE

Hope someday I can be a professional FE developer. :) ‚òÑÔ∏è
